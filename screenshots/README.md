# App Screenshots

This directory contains screenshots for the PWA app store listings.

## Required Screenshots

For optimal PWA support, provide:

### Mobile Screenshots (narrow form factor)
- Recommended size: 540x720 or 1080x1920
- Show the app running on a mobile device
- Capture key features and UI

### Desktop Screenshots (wide form factor)
- Recommended size: 1280x720 or 1920x1080
- Show the app running on desktop
- Capture key features and UI

## Taking Screenshots

1. Open the app in your browser
2. Use browser DevTools to set the viewport size
3. Take screenshots of key screens:
   - Message list with conversations
   - Settings panel
   - Configuration wizard

## Temporary Placeholder

Screenshots are optional for PWA functionality. The app will work without them, but they improve the installation experience.
